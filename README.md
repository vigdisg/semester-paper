# Semester paper: Causality and Distributional Robustness
 
 Rcode_example1,2,3 are implementations of the causal invariance methods, [Invariant Causal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01332) and [Anchor regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06229). IRMcode is an implementation of [Invariant Risk Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02893) for the same three examples as in the R code. The examples are discussed in chapter 5.
 
 SimpleICPproblem.R is code for the Invariant Causal Prediction example in chapter 2.
